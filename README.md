# go-gedcom555

go-gedcom555 might take a stab at implementing GEDCOM version 5.5.5, but for now it's a collection of notes.

*GEDCOM* is the generally accepted standard format for genealogical files. <br/>
However, the last update had been "GEDCOM 5.5.1 beta" way back in 1999.

GEDCOM 5.5.5 is a new version, just approved in late 2019.

Currently there are two Golang codebases addressing GEDCOM.

* iand (obsolete?) - [code](https://github.com/iand/gedcom) - [docu](https://godoc.org/github.com/iand/gedcom)
* elliotchance (under active dev'mt) - [code](https://github.com/elliotchance/gedcom) - [docu](https://godoc.org/github.com/elliotchance/gedcom)
